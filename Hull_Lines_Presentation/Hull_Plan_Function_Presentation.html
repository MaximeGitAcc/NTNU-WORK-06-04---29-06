      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>During my internship at NTNU, I had the opportunity to work on an project involving the development of
        JavaScript functions for visualizing various plans useful for studying a ship's hull.
        This project allowed me to delve deeply into the technical aspects of naval design and put my programming skills
        into practice.</p>
      <p>This page aims to present the result of this work by showcasing the different functions I developed and their
        usage. These functions are designed to utilize data contained in JSON files describing ship characteristics.</p>
      This file contains all the information about the ship studied. To use the examples that follow, you can download
      any JSON file using the link then import the file below.
      By default, the charts will be displayed using the JSON file of a Yard patrol craft ship.</p>

      </br>
      <center><input type="file" id="fileInput" accept=".json" title="Select a file"></center></br>
      <p>The JSON file that we use is seen as a java object. Literally JavaScript Object Notation (JSON), here our
        object is a ship so it has properties such as the speed, the length and width of the boat, its capacity...</p>
      <p>But also and above all informations on its hull. Which can be found in the “structure” then “hull” property of
        our JSON
        file. And it is in this part of the file that we find the values ​​of the offsets table.</p>

    <div id="Offset_Table">
      <h2>I] Offsets Table</h2>
      <p>The offset table is a table that helps describe the shape of a ship's hull in three dimensions.It's devided in
        two parts.</p>

      <p><b>Parts of the table of offsets :</b></p>

      <p><u>Half Breadth :</u><br>

        Half Breadth refer to the horizontal distances between the ship's centerline (longitudinal center) and the
        exterior surface of the hull at different stations and waterlines. This part of the offset table describes the
        lateral shape of the hull. These lines are used to draw the half Breadths plan and the body plan.</p>

      <p><u>Heights :</u><br>

        Heights refer to the vertical distances from the base plane of the ship (often the keel) to the outer surface of
        the hull at various stations and buttock lines. This part of the offset table describes the vertical shape of
        the hull. These lines are used to draw the sheer plan</p>

      <p><b>Content of the table of offsets :</b></p>

      <p><u>In Column, Stations: </u><br>

        The columns represent stations, which are vertical cross sections of the hull at different points along the
        length of the ship.</p>

      <p><u>Waterlines in Lines:</u><br>

        Waterlines represent horizontal levels on the hull, measured at various heights from the keel or bottom of the
        ship. They are often spaced at regular intervals, such as every foot or meter.</p>

      <p><u>Buttocklines:</u><br>

        Buttock lines are vertical lines parallel to the centerline of the ship, taken at regular intervals on either
        side of this line. They make it possible to describe the longitudinal shape of the hull in terms of height.</p>

    <div id="HalfBreadthPlan">
      <h2>II] Half Breadth Plan</h2>
      <p>The Half Breadth Plan is an essential representation in marine construction, describing the lateral shape of
        the hull by half-breadths measured at specific stations and waterlines. It is crucial for the precise design,
        construction and verification of hull form, ensuring that the vessel has the desired characteristics in terms of
        performance and stability.</p>

      <p>To draw this chart on an html page, I went through a JS script that uses the chart.js library. With this
        library we can create a modular graph, thanks to different properties. Of course first of all the abscissas and
        ordinates, but also the legend, the labels of the axes, properties of the plot, display or not the points on the
        plot, title and the fact that it is responsive or not.</br></br></p>

    <div id="Sheer">
      <h2>III] Sheer Plan</h2>
      <p>The sheer plan, also called a profile plan or longitudinal elevation plan, is an essential technical drawing in
        shipbuilding. It represents the side (profile) view of a ship. This plan shows the outline and main lines of the
        ship as they appear when viewed from the side, from bow to stern.</p>

    <div id="Body">
      <h2>IV] Body Plan</h2>
      <p>The body plan, also called cross-section plan or template plan, is another essential technical drawing in
        shipbuilding. It represents the cross sections of a ship's hull, viewed from the front (bow) and rear (stern).
        This plan shows the shape and contours of the hull at different positions along the length of the ship.</p>

    <div id="Conclusion">
      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>The functions presented allow for the calculation of characteristic values of a boat's hull based on data
        present in a JSON file. The coefficient values could not be verified, and the quality of the results greatly
        depends on the accuracy of the HalfBreadths table. The more points provided, the more accurate the calculations
        will be.</br>
        However, if the Draft value lies between two waterlines, a new waterline is created by interpolation. This helps
        to make
        the values of the submerged volume, Cw, and the coordinates of the Buoyancy point more accurate.</p>
